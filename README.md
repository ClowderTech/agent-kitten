# Agent Kitten V1

I decided to open source the original version of Agent Kitten. I want people who write python discord bots to have a good framework to base their own bots off of. 

I plan on releasing a slim version of Agent Kitten V2 as open source for anyone to use, which is in typescript. However this will come in the future

Feel free to contribue, add issues, or do whatever you like with this framework.
